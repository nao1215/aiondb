# AION DB - In-memory SQL engine for testing purpose

## [WIP] This is a work in progress.
## What is AION DB?
AION DB is an in-memory SQL engine for testing purpose. It is designed to be used in unit tests to test SQL queries without the need to connect to a real database. AION DB is influenced by [proullon/ramsql](https://github.com/proullon/ramsql).

AION DB is not yet complete. It has no functionalities at the moment. AION DB will have its own SQL parser and aims to cover the syntax of popular RDBMS as much as possible. There are plans to enable interactive SQL execution using AION SHELL as well.
